\## 🚀 Project Overview



The workflow includes:



\- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

\- Data cleaning \& preprocessing

\- Feature engineering

\- Modeling using \*\*CatBoost\*\*

\- Model evaluation \& predictions

\- Generating a Kaggle submission file



All processing and modeling steps are implemented in \*\*Jupyter Notebooks\*\*.
